# Interactive Genetic Algorithm for Art Design

This is a project that using Cartesian Genetic Programming(CGP)and Interactive Evolutionary Computation(IEC) to achieve abstract art design. This project will simply included three files - App.py, cgp.py and ImageGenerator.py.

The App.py included the interface of the program.

The cgp.py is the CGP logic, including mutate„ÄÅcrossover and so on.

The ImageGenerator.py included the functions which generate pirctures.

What's more, because CGP uses mutate only previously, the programming just recurs the work  ```A_new_crossover_technique_for_Cartesian_genetic_programming``` by Julian Francis Miller for adding cross_over function for the program.


## Execute the program

- For running the program:
```python App.py```

- The interface of the program:
