# Interactive Genetic Algorithm for Cartoon Design

This is a project that using Interactive Genetic Algorithm(IGA) to achieve cartoon design. This project will simply included two files - App.py and IGA.py

The App.py included the interface of the program.

The IGA.py is the IGA logic.

## Dataset

- This dataset is downloaded from the Internet.

- The path of dataset will be:  
```/components/```

- The data included difference components of a cartoon character.

## Execute the program

- For running the program:
```python App.py```

- The interface of the program:
